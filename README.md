- [convertoncloud] to convert my ios video/mov to a mp4 so thatit works using html
# New Things learned
- This is really learned but a forgotten requirement to use Justify-content you have to have the display flex attribute
- This was my first time working with video and audio. Mov/ video from ios devices are not compatible to work in all browsers and mmp4ay need to be convert to another file type
I chose mp4  / control attribute allows for the user to beable to play, pause / autoplay attribute allows for you to decide when it begins (i chose auto) / I used muted attribute as I didn't want any sound from the video. Also you can use the src attribute to add the video or you can add a source tag inside the video tag (They accomplish the same task)
